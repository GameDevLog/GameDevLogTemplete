IMPORTANT - READ BEFORE DOWNLOADING THE ASSETS

The assets that you find here are created by freelance artists that I paid to create the assets, or I have purchased pre made assets somewhere online or I got the assets with an agreement from their creator without paying anything.

I got a permission to use the assets for educational purposes and share the assets with you so that you can learn by following my tutorials.

Because of that you only have permission to use the assets for EDUCATIONAL purposes, which means you can only use them to follow the tutorials on my YouTube channel EXCEPT in cases where you have a " READ ME " or any other text file that comes with the assets, then you will behave according to the license that you will find in that text file.

You CAN'T sell these assets or create commercial games that you plan to publish online EXCEPT in cases where you find a license in the above mentioned text file that allows you to create and publish games with those assets.

Thank you for your understanding.
